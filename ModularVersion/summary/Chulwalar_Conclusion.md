###The correlation between "As Is" and "Plan" of various external indicators were tested and the results showed a very strong correlation. The planning at Chulwalar already showed high accuracy from the onset

###A comparison of forecasting performance vs historical performance (2008-2013) were made using seven different forecasting models. Additionally, 2014 forecasting performance was also conducted for error measure RMSE.

###When comparing forecasting models, the "best" model will have the smallest error measures. The results from the table shows that Holt-Winter's multiplicative method is the most accurate according to RMSE, MAE, MAPE and MASE while the Holt's Dampened trend is most accurate according to ME. Also, when comparing RMSE for 2014 data, Holt-Winter's additive method is the most accurate
