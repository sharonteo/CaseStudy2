A comparison of forecasting performance vs historical performance (2008-2013) were made using seven different forecasting models. 
Additionally, the forecasting performance for the year 2014 was also conducted for error measure RMSE. 

When comparing forecasting models, the “best” model will have the smallest error measures. The results from the table shows that
Holt-Winter’s multiplicative method is the most accurate according to RMSE, MAE, MAPE and MASE while the Holt’s Dampened trend is the
most accurate according to ME. Also, when comparing RMSE for 2014 data, Holt-Winter’s additive method is the most accurate
